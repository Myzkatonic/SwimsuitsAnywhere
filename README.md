# SwimsuitsAnywhere
Have you ever wanted your farmer to rock a swimsuit outside of the bathhouse? If so, you're in luck! This is a simple mod for Stardew Valley allowing players to toggle between normal clothes and swimsuits from anywhere on the map, designed to be simple, lightweight, and compatible with pretty much any other mods. It also contains an optional updated swimsuit sprite for your farmer if you're looking to step up your beach style. This is my first mod and I'm still learning the ropes, so if you have any feedback at all please let me know so I can keep learning and improving!  


## Features
- Toggle between swimsuit and normal clothes anywhere on the map. 
- Set a customizable hotkey for changing into swimsuitÂ (default is J)
- Optional updated assets for your swimsuit sprite
- More to come, such as more swimsuit styles, gender neutral options, and more!


## Installation
1. Download and install the latest version of [SMAPI](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/2400).
2. Download and unzip SwimsuitsAnywhere. 
3. Move the unzipped SwimsuitsAnywhere folder into your Stardew Valley Mods folder. 

## Configuration
On config.json you can configure the mod with the following options:
- **ChangeKey:** The hotkey used to toggle in and out of swimsuits. (default = J)
- **updateSprite:** Toggle the updated spritesheet for this mod's custom swimsuit sprites. Set to "false" to disable. (default = true)


## Compatibility
This mod should be compatible with any other mods. For other mods involving updated spritesheets for farmer bases or pants, you might need to set updatedSprite to false on config.json. Additionally, make sure that the hotkey for changing into swimsuits is set to a key that doesn't clash with any other mods' hotkeys.
